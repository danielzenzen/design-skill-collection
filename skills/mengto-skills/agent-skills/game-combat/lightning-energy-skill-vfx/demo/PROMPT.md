# Black Lightning: demo prompts

## Minimal prompt

Use $lightning-energy-skill-vfx to give this character's lightning punch its effects, dynamic but never in your face. Hang a storm-cloud orb off the fist socket: a ray-marched billow surface, dark blue with lit lobes and near-black creases that churn in place, lit from inside by a small white-hot core and by 10–15 jagged lightning ribbons that run from the core to the inner wall like a plasma globe, each holding its shape for a few ticks, with crawlers on the rim and a hairline blue fresnel. Its lens bends only the air just outside it. Give the orb its own black shadow, a torn teardrop with dry-brush edges and flecks that streams behind it along its motion, plus ribbons and billows laid along its path. Throw lightning as trees of strips: a fine white core in a violet-blue glow, forks of forks and dozens of hair-fine branchlets, hot beads along each channel. Each channel reaches out from its origin as a stepped leader, flares as it connects, holds, and fades through an afterglow; one discharge at a time, rooted at the orb's membrane, the main strikes aimed. Where a bolt meets the ground: a small white-hot contact, a low light over wet stone, arcs crawling along the stone's own cracks, hairline heat in the cracks, chips and dust, and the bolt reflected in the puddles. On the hit, fire a few divergent bolts, refraction-only air fronts, a ground burst, a spark fountain, fractured rocks that land, then a 0.1 s hold as a full-frame ink negative with tapered speed lines, and a gentle drop-and-rebound shake. Ease the orb between beats. Keep the bloom threshold high and tinted blue so the black stays black, and limit inverting flashes to three a second.

## Recreate the demo

Build **Black Lightning** as one self-contained HTML file that opens straight from disk. Use Three.js r170 from a local classic script, WebGL2 and GLSL `ShaderMaterial`s, and `assets/storm-energy.mjs` inlined by `demo/build.mjs`. Make no network requests.

The page shows a close-combat energy skill without a character model. The orb hangs off an implied fist over a plain of dark, damp cracked ground under a slate night sky with dim torn cloud, fog matched to a (0.017, 0.024, 0.036) horizon. The ground is Poly Haven's CC0 "Dry Ground 01" scan (1k colour, normal and AO/roughness maps embedded as data URIs) at 6 m a tile, re-tinted to wet slate; its wet hollows reflect the lightning, and strike arcs walk the cracks in its AO channel.

- **Beats**, played in a loop or one at a time:
  - **Charge** (3.6 s): the orb grows from 0.1 to 0.5 m and motes are drawn in. Once it is full it strikes one spot in front of it about every half second, 2–3 return strokes down a single trunk to a lit contact, with arcs crawling along the cracks. A 0.05 s warning hold comes at 3.0 s.
  - **Dash** (2.6 s): a crouch, then three zigzag legs of 0.2 s each with the camera close behind the orb. The orb's black shadow lays out along the path, and a held bolt snaps from the orb back along it every few ticks. The dash ends in a skid of sparks.
  - **Barrage** (4.4 s): a straight punch held for 0.1 s as a full-frame ink negative with speed lines, then a reverse swing with a fan of 4 bolts, then a spinning elbow into a second heavy hit.
  - **Storm ring** (4.4 s): a leap and slam, then a six-band shadow vortex up in the sky and 20 fractured rocks floating low in the domain. The discharge is a fan from the orb, struck one channel at a time: four steep trunks to one side and one long arm to the other, each holding 4–7 ticks, landing in a flash and reflected in the wet stone. The ring squeezes on each gesture.
  - **Ultimate** (6.2 s): a time ramp to 0.4, shadow spiralling in, cold motes, and the orb swelling to 0.9 m and burning brighter, with two great channels crossing through it in an X to the corners of the frame. The release is bursts at strength 2.2, a ring of shadow streams, a 0.15 s full-frame negative, a white flash, a radial shake and a 0.42 fisheye. Embers, slow smoke and residual arcs follow.
- **Camera:** a spring follows each beat's framing and freezes during holds. Portrait screens back it off by (1/aspect)^0.55. Shake runs at 0.6 and fisheye at 0.65 of the module's numbers.
- **Interface (minimal):** no panels.
  - Top left: a 14px title, "Black Lightning", over an 11px tracked line, "ENERGY SKILL VFX · THREE.JS".
  - Bottom left: four switches as small text rows, each an 11px uppercase label with two 12px options: **Lightning** (Re-rolled / Tweened), **Afterimage** (Smoke over / Additive), **Orb** (Air lens / Glow ball), **Flashes** (Full / Safe). Above them, an 11px note explains the chosen failure.
  - Bottom centre: a 13px play/pause icon, the beats as plain text with a 4px dot under the active one, and a 64px range with an 8px thumb.
  - A faint scrim fades up 150px from the bottom edge. The beat caption sits at the top right, and the hide hint (H) at the bottom right.
  - Below 1180px the options move above the dock. Below 760px the options and beats scroll sideways and the caption hides. Nothing renders under 11px.
- **Accessibility:** under reduced motion, hold a composed still of the charge, set safe flashes, turn off shake and fisheye, and play beats only on request. Every control is a real button or range with a visible #a9d6ff focus outline, and changes are announced in a live region.

## Remix prompt

Keep the mechanism and the budgets from $lightning-energy-skill-vfx:

- one effect clock with holds and time ramps, and one distortion buffer;
- an orb drawn as a lit billow surface with real lightning ribbons inside, spread evenly from its core;
- a shadow that hangs off the orb as a torn teardrop with billows along its path;
- lightning as trees of strips in one point ring, grown as stepped leaders, held and faded, one discharge at a time from the orb's membrane, ground strikes that follow the world's cracks and reflect in wet ground;
- refraction-only air fronts and a high bloom threshold;
- impact frames as ink negatives with speed lines, limited to three a second.

Change everything else. Make it a frost-and-void skill on a moonlit glacier:

- pale cyan lightning with violet halos instead of white-blue;
- an orb of frozen, frost-lit cloud with violet arcs round a white core;
- a deep indigo shadow with frost tatters;
- cold blue-white embers instead of orange sparks, and snow dust;
- ice chips that skate before they rest;
- heat that glows in the glacier's own crevasses.

The interface stays minimal: a caption at the bottom left and a single **Flashes** switch.
