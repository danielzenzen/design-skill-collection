# Game Combat Skills

How to make character combat animation look right: attacks, skills and whole move sets that read like Diablo IV, Baldur's Gate 3 or Elden Ring, with arms, wrists and hands that never stretch, lock, wring or break. These skills come from real rounds of building, measuring and blind-judging a knight's sword strikes and an archer's bow shots in a Three.js action RPG.

Each rule is a number, every number has a test, and every critic's claim is checked against full-resolution frames before anything changes.

The body is half of a skill; the other half is what it throws, raises or tears open, and what it does to the target. `game-dev-combat-skill-polish` scores and rebuilds whole skills, body, effect and result, from filmed casts, against a readability bar and an art bar.

## Choose the right skill

| Need | Start with |
| --- | --- |
| Build, fix or review attacks and move sets to a written standard; fix "the arms look stretched or weird"; score animations or get them to 8 out of 10 | [`game-dev-combat-animation`](game-dev-combat-animation/SKILL.md) |
| Score every combat skill or spell out of 10 with blind judges and raise the weakest to a bar: readability (does it read as itself, does the blow land on the beat) or art (detail, light, trails, impact, art direction, against a reference such as Diablo IV) | [`game-dev-combat-skill-polish`](game-dev-combat-skill-polish/SKILL.md) |

## What's inside `game-dev-combat-animation`

- **The loop.** Write the standard, capture a baseline, design keys from anatomy, measure, test, capture both cameras, run blind critics and a blind A/B against the last release, verify every claim, ship, then show videos.
- **Arm and hand rules, with numbers.**

  | Rule | Limit |
  | --- | --- |
  | Elbow flexion | 10–152° |
  | Striking or drawing arm, middle 80% of the move | at least 20° of bend |
  | Wrist | bend ≤ 50°, roll ≤ 45° |
  | Forearm and upper-arm twist | ≤ 52° each |
  | Arm raise | ≤ 105° |
  | Skin, worst 1% of each arm region on the real mesh | stretch ≤ 2×, crush ≤ 3× |
  | Hands | always in a pose: fist, hook or relaxed |

- **Techniques:**
  - hands that ride their shoulders and arc between keys;
  - aim the forearm, not the wrist;
  - tip-up chambers;
  - follow-throughs that keep moving;
  - a bow anchor under the jaw with the hips side-on.
- **Traps that each cost a round.**
  - Bone-axis conventions, such as a head bone that is +Y forward and +Z down.
  - Tests that read the same wrong convention as the code.
  - Failures masked by the first assertion in a loop.
  - Poses that read differently on two cameras.
  - Critics misreading thumbnails.
  - Capture runs killed by a reload.
- **Review protocol:** two blind critics (the lower score counts), a blind A/B with identical titles, critic and judge prompt templates, and side-by-side review videos.

## Scripts at a glance

- `scripts/install.sh` copies the tools into a checkout's `.dream-loop/moves/`.
- `keydesign.mjs` turns upper-arm, forearm and blade intents into a hand target and checks raise, flex, blade angle and reach.
- `armcheck.mjs` checks joint ranges and skin stretch and crush per arm region on every frame.
- `at.mjs`, `knight-measure.mjs`, `anchor.mjs`, `drawfit.mjs` and `face.mjs` probe the fist and blade, clearances, the bow anchor and the face landmarks.
- `setup.js`, `play.js`, `shot.js` and `host.html` capture the Characters page, stepped in-game frames, and 2880 × 1800 stills.
- `msheet.py`, `psheet.py`, `ab-pack.py`, `vidcompose.py` and `encode.swift` build judge sheets, blind A/B sets and side-by-side videos.

The tools import the game's own modules (a HumGen rig and baker). Project specifics are in `references/thornvigil.md`. On another rig, re-derive the arm lengths, the shoulders and every bone-local axis from mesh landmarks before reusing a number.

## What's inside `game-dev-combat-skill-polish`

- **The loop.** Pin down the skills, the bar and the reference; film the real cast on a stopped, stepped clock; build contact strips (timing) and close-ups (art); judge blind with two fresh subagents, lower score kept and a re-judge before trusting a 7; raise the criterion costing the most; lock it in with a test and ship it as its own version.
- **Two rubrics, 0–2 per part:** readability (reads, timing, body, effect, reaction) and art (detail and texture, light, motion and trails, impact, art direction, with Diablo IV described in words).
- **Levers that moved scores** (four skills went from 3.5–4.5 to 7+):
  - results that land when the blow, missile or wave arrives, never on the click;
  - a skill's own schedule and keyed move instead of a borrowed one;
  - a hero prop made from a painted concept with image-to-3D (scripted primitives plateau at 5.5–6.5);
  - painted additive textures on black, gradient-mapped to the palette;
  - camera-facing ribbons that widen along the path;
  - metals with their own small environment map and a tight rim;
  - light beside the body, not inside it or pooled under a projectile.
- **What judges always mark down:** borrowed looks, flat white placeholder flashes, pillars of light over the target, additive dust rings, stretched white sparks, long "laser" trails, anything under the HUD.

### Its scripts

All inside `game-dev-combat-skill-polish/`, with no dependencies beyond Node, Python and Pillow:
- `scripts/film.mjs` films a cast in headless Chrome over CDP on a frozen clock stepped 0.05 s per frame. The game supplies review-only hooks (stage, act, aim the camera, freeze and step); `HOOK`, `PAGE`, `READY`, `SETTINGS_KEY` and `CHROME` come from the environment, and staging goes in a scenarios file like `scripts/scenarios.example.mjs`.
- `scripts/probe.mjs` takes one still of a recipe or cast at a chosen step; `scripts/perf.mjs` counts draw calls and triangles before and during a cast.
- `scripts/strips.py` and `scripts/close.py` build contact strips and key-frame close-ups.
- `scripts/judge-set.py` with `templates/judge-prompt.md` makes anonymised judging rounds (neutral ids, a list file, a key) and holds the two judge prompts; `scripts/merge.py` keeps the lower of both judges' totals.
- `scripts/beforeafter.py` makes a labelled before/after sheet for the scorecard.

Project specifics (review hooks, harness settings, where each skill's code lives, scores so far) go in a local `references/<project>.md` next to the skill.

Both pair well with [`design-action-combat`](../game-development/design-action-combat/SKILL.md) for timing and contact, and with [`workflow-score-to-target`](../workflow/workflow-score-to-target/SKILL.md) and [`workflow-ship-change`](../workflow/workflow-ship-change/SKILL.md).
